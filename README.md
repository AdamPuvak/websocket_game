<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The game is an online multiplayer experience for two players, created using WebSockets.
It is inspired by the popular game Paper.io, where each player aims to control and capture as much territory as possible.
Before the start of the game, first player sets time limit in seconds and initiates the game. 

## Gameplay Features
### Movement & Territory:
Players use mouse or arrow keys to move their cursor, leaving a trail. Closing the trail forms a territory, which is then filled with their color.

### Competition:
Players can capture each other's territory and eliminate the opponent by crossing over their incomplete trail.

### Competing with the Opponent:
Players can capture each other's territory and eliminate the opponent by crossing over their incomplete trail.

### Game End:
The game can end in two ways:

**Opponent Elimination:** The game ends if a player crosses over the opponentâ€™s unfinished trail, eliminating them.

**Time Limit:** If the time limit expires, the player with the most captured territory wins.
